# PKGBUILDs missed from AUR

Maintaining PKGBUILDs that I do want to use but not in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) now

## Why not registering to AUR?

I don't want to claim "maintainer" for these packages becase of the followings:

- Maybe there's some reason for disappearing from AUR
- I hadn't done any contribution to these packages in there
